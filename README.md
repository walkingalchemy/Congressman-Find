# Welcome to Congressman Find
> A simple CLI to discover information about U.S. Congressional Representatives


Congressman Find is a command line interface to discover current information about the members and committees of the United States Congress.  Using information from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/)'s excellent [Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/) it can display Representatives and Senators based on location or committee and deliver the contact information of their offices and social media accounts.

## Installing / Getting started

Congressman Find is written in Ruby and can be used by cloning down a copy of the project as it has not been packaged into an installable as of yet.

It was built and tested with [Ruby 2.3.3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2016/11/21/ruby-2-3-3-released/).  

Library dependancies can be installed from the top level directory via:
```
bundle install
bundle update
```

From there it can be run with:
```
ruby bin/run.rb
```
